I work really closely with the Unix Support function, and collectively we support close to ten thousand systems, ranging in function from large customer management database systems all the way to immutable infrastructure responsible for streaming video to mobile devices.\r\n\r\nI have a proven ability to deliver complex project requirements at extremely short notice.  For example, I've delivered and automated the deployment of a 65-node Hadoop cluster, built using HP ProLiant hardware and the Cloudera CDH software stack.  It was essential to perform this quickly, reliably and repeatably - I used Red Hat's Kickstart along with a good amount of shell and Puppet code to deliver a recovery solution that allowed nodes to be rebuilt at the push of a button.  Even though this was all needed super-urgently, I still managed to hand it all over before the rest of the project required it. \r\n\r\nComplex database and application migration work is something that I'm very comfortable planning and performing.  For example, I was the technical lead responsible for executing storage migrations for 11 business critical Oracle databases.  Detailed plans were written and scheduled accordingly within ITIL change management guidelines.  Ultimately, all databases were migrated successfully and were handed back to the customer before the end of the given outage window.  \r\n\r\nI'm familiar with a range of data copying and replication technologies.  This could be anything from from block-level replication at the storage array level, host-based mirroring techniques or even straight-up file transfers.  My understanding of these techniques has allowed me to, for example, write scripts which are able to establish and monitor the replication of terabytes worth of data without administrator involvement.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exciting things that I've been involved with has been helping to pioneer the next generation of Sky's build automation infrastructure.  I played a pivotal role writing modules for inclusion in our Puppet codebase and was responsible for the deployment and administration of a Katello instance to provide packages to new builds.\r\n\r\nThere are loads of other things that I'm really proud of having achieved here, too.  Every day is different, and every day I learn something new!\r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\n#### Sky\r\n**Technology Graduate**  \r\n**July 2011 - July 2013**\r\n  \r\nI joined the Sky Technology Graduate Scheme, which consisted of four placements:\r\n  \r\n**Enterprise Network Support Analyst** (September 2011 - January 2012)  \r\nMy role in this team was to provide support for Sky's corporate network, consisting primarily of Cisco network devices (Catalyst & Nexus switches, ACE load balancers, FWSM firewalls).  I also provided support for the numerous leased lines that we operate and support across the world.  My largest project here involved performing a complete audit of the supported estate.  One of my biggest achievements was successfully introducing the concept of data collection from devices using `bash`, Perl and `expect`.\r\n\r\n**Genesys Implementation Engineer** (February 2012 - July 2012)  \r\nI worked on delivering new features to our customer call-centre capability using Genesys products across a vast Windows Server 2003 platform.  I successfully delivered projects which allowed customer calls to be recorded and archived.  I took responsibility for reviewing and improving our monitoring platform.  I automated common tasks using Microsoft PowerShell.\r\n\r\n**Technical Analyst - Unix Team** (July 2012 - January 2013)  \r\nI worked as a support and infrastructure delivery resource within the Unix team.  Having never worked within this area before, I relished the opportunity to absorb as much knowledge as I could.  I became a competent shell scripter and took on a great deal of responsibility for bugfixing and refactoring the team's server build scripts.  I learnt a great deal about enterprise storage solutions and high-availability of services.  One of my independent projects involved developing a bespoke web-based monitoring platform for Oracle GoldenGate deployments, which was deeply appreciated by the Oracle database support team.  \r\n\r\nI was offered a full-time role in the Unix team following this placement.\r\n\r\n**Broadcast Network Support Analyst** (January 2013 - July 2013)  \r\nI provided support for the cutting-edge networks which enable Sky's television broadcast systems.  I was involved in fault analysis and platform improvement discussions with a wide range of users.  I automated and scripted repetitive data analysis operations with `bash`, Perl and `expect`.\r\n\r\nI designed and implemented a bespoke web application for support users - it allowed them to record details of our leased data  and their related support relationships.  The implementation of this project involved a great deal of relational database design using MySQL and web front-end development with PHP.  This application continues to be used within the team to this day!\r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\n#### KJT Consulting\r\n**Technical Consultant**  \r\n**June 2010 - December 2010**\r\n  \r\nI performed freelance technology projects for a human resources consultancy group.\r\n\r\nI provided: \r\n\r\n- In-depth analysis of large datasets using `bash` and communicated the results to non-technical stakeholders.\r\n- Network design, hardware deployment and support functions for the company's head-office.\r\n- Advice with regards to technology-related company developments.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\n#### Misc. Hospitality Roles\r\n**Various positions, all at a leadership level**  \r\n**August 2005 - June 2010**\r\n  \r\nI worked with a range of well respected companies throughout school and university in order to support myself.  \r\n\r\nIn each role, I quickly became a trusted and indispensable member of staff who genuinely cared about providing great service to customers.  As such, I tended to get promoted to leadership roles extremely quickly.\r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\n### Academics\r\n\r\n#### University of the West of Scotland\r\n**BSc Honours Computer Networking - First Class**  \r\n\r\n**Dissertation:** \r\n- \"Power Consumption of Network Devices\"\r\n  \r\n**Modules:**\r\n- Cisco CCNA curriculum (Modules 1-3)\r\n- Data & Computer Communications\r\n- Network Design\r\n- Network Security\r\n- Wireless Networking\r\n- UNIX Network Administration\r\n- Windows Domain Administration\r\n- Relational Database Design\r\n- Object Oriented Analysis\r\n- Intelligent Machines\r\n- Management Information Systems\r\n- Modern Business Technology\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Awards:**\r\n- Court Medal, 2010 - Awarded to highest performing student in year group\r\n- Court Medal, 2006 - Awarded to highest performing student in year group\r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\n#### Personal Interests\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I like:\r\n \r\n- Technology - keeping up with news and latest developments.\r\n- Music - Playing guitar, attending gigs, collecting records.\r\n- Cycling\r\n- Cooking and eating out.\r\n- Current affairs and politics. \r\n- Really good coffee.\r\n- Really good beer.\r\n- Videogames\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
