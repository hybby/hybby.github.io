### summary

i'm a highly effective technology professional with a real passion for working with *nix systems.  i have a proven history of fixing difficult problems.  i genuinely love working with complex systems and finding out exactly what makes them tick.

i'm really enthusiastic about automation and am always striving to do better.  i always think about how we can do things faster, more consistently and with fewer mistakes.  i have no interest in performing the same tasks over and over again; i'd rather go to lunch while my automation takes care of it.  i have a keen interest in the open source community and love keeping up to date with the latest developments.

i really care about the people who use systems that i'm responsible for.  i'm a huge proponent of helping developers to work to the best of their ability by providing the correct toolsets for them, and helping them to understand the infrastructure they're working on. 

if you're looking for a really competent sysadmin-type who is super-passionate about getting stuff done, i'm your man.

### employment history

#### sky
**technical analyst - unix sysadmin**  
**july 2013 - present**
  
i work for sky as a unix sysadmin within the infrastructure delivery section of operations engineering.  we look after thousands of systems - they can range in function from large customer management database systems all the way to immutable machines responsible for streaming video to mobile devices.

largely, i deliver new infrastructure for large projects using a range of technologies.  i'm familiar with delivering systems which require high availability across multiple datacentres.  i also have a proven ability to take project requirements and deliver a large amount of infrastructure at short notice.  for example, i have delivered a 65-node hadoop cluster using hp proliant hardware and the cloudera cdh stack.  it was essential to perform this quickly, reliably and repeatably - i used redhat kickstart, shell and puppet dsl to deliver a recovery solution where nodes can be rebuilt at the push of a button.     

i'm familiar and comfortable planning and carrying out complex migration work.  i was the technical lead responsible for executing the rapid storage migration of 11 business critical oracle databases.  all databases were migrated successfully and handed back to the customer before the expiration of some tight outage windows.

i also act as top tier support for any unix-related support incidents which come through.  i've discovered my fair share of bugs in software and work effectively with vendors to help them understand and resolve the problems that we discover. 

i had the pleasure of helping to pioneer the next generation of sky's automated build infrastructure.  i played a pivotal role  writing modules for inclusion in our puppet dsl codebase and was responsible for the deployment and administration of a katello instance to provide packages to new builds.

i do loads of other stuff too - every day is different, and every day i learn something new!

#### sky
**technology graduate**  
**july 2011 - july 2013**
  
i joined the sky technology graduate scheme, which consisted of four placements:
  
**enterprise network support analyst** (sept 2011 - jan 2012)  
i acted as a support resource for sky's enterprise network, which consisted primarily of cisco devices (catalyst / nexus switches, ace load balancers, fwsm firewalls).  i performed a complete audit of the entire network estate.  i also introduced the concept of automation and script development within the team using `bash`, Perl and `expect`.

**genesys implementation engineer** (feb 2012 - july 2012)  
i worked on delivering new features to our customer call-centre capability using genesys products on a vast windows server 2003 platform.  i successfully delivered projects which allowed customer calls to be recorded and archived.  i took responsibility for reviewing and improving our opsview monitoring platform.  i performed a raft of automation for common tasks using powershell.

**unix technical analyst** (july 2012 - jan 2013)  
i worked as a support engineer within the infrastructure delivery function of operations engineering.  having never worked with unix systems before, i enthusiastically became a competent shell scripter, taking on a great deal of responsibility for bugfixing and refactoring our build scripts.  i learnt about enterprise storage solutions and independently developed a bespoke web-based monitoring platform for our oracle goldengate deployments.

**broadcast network support analyst** (jan 2013 - july 2013)  
i provided top-tier support for the numerous cutting-edge networks within sky's broadcast systems.  i was involved in fault analysis and platform improvement discussions with a wide range of users.  i automated and scripted repetitive data analysis operations with `bash`, Perl and `expect`.

i designed and delivered a bespoke web application which allowed team members to record details of third party data circuits and their related support relationships.  this consisted of relational database design and implementation using mysql and web front-end development with php.  this solution continues to be used to this day!

#### misc. hospitality / bar roles
**team leadership roles**  
**august 2005 - june 2010**
  
i worked with a range of well respected companies throughout secondary school and university in order to support myself.  in each role, i quickly became an indispensable member of staff who genuinely cared about providing great service to our customers.  as such, i tended to get promoted to 'team leader' and 'senior' roles extremely quickly.

i can talk more about this with you, but i'm more passionate about my career within technology :)
